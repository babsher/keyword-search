Create a keyword matcher

MetricStory needs a way for customers to put in natural language sentences and take the keywords from the
sentence and match / rank it against sentences with keywords in the MetricStory database. The output
should be an array of JSON objects sorted by rank.

Example

Input
'How are my Facebook marketing campaigns performing?'

Keywords Extracted
['facebook', 'marketing', 'campaigns', 'performing']

DB Match: How are my Facebook ads performing?  [‘facebook‘, ‘performing’]

Output
{
input: ‘How are my Facebook marketing campaigns performing?’,
inputKeywords: ['facebook', 'marketing', 'campaigns', 'performing'],
matchedKeywords: [‘facebook’, ‘performing’],
rank: 2,
output: ‘How are my Facebook ads performing?’’
}
